<p id="nus">1/ Syria, one of the world’s oldest inhabited regions, is home to a history that dates back over 10,000 years. Damascus, its capital, is considered the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world.<br>

2/ Ancient civilizations like the Assyrians, Arameans, and Romans thrived here. Syria was part of the Silk Road and later became a cultural center of the Islamic world.<br>

3/ Syria’s diversity is one of its strengths—Arab, Kurdish, Assyrian, Druze, and Armenian communities have all coexisted for centuries.<br>

4/ Since 2011, Syria has been devastated by civil war, leading to massive displacement, destruction, and humanitarian crisis.<br>

5/ Despite the war, Syrian people continue to show resilience, creativity, and hope—both within the country and across the global diaspora.<br>

6/ From poetry and cuisine to music and architecture, Syria’s cultural heritage remains a treasure for humanity.<br>

7/ Let’s not forget Syria is more than conflict. It’s history, beauty, and people deserve to be remembered and supported.</p>
